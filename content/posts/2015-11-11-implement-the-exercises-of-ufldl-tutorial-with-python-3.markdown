In recent years, deep learning has received more and more attention and is applied to many things in our daily life.
Thus, I decide to dig into this powerful technology by self-teaching.

Last month, I started to study [UFLDL Tutorial](http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial) which is an excellent learning material contributed by [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng).
I really like his way to explain concepts and appreciate his generosity to carefully prepare the online courses.

In UFLDL Tutorial, the exercises are originally supposed to be done with Matlab.
However, I have no Matlab license.
Thus, I chose python (with version 3.4) to implement those exercises.
The codes and related introduction can be found [here](https://github.com/tsaith/ufldl_tutorial).
