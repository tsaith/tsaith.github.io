The essential idea of [STFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-time_Fourier_transform) is to perform the Fourier transform on each shorter time interval of the total time series to find out the frequency spectrum at each time point.

In the following example, we will show how to use STFT to perform time-frequency analysis on signals.
